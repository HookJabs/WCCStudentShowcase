§Transitioning Home – Collectivism v Individualism in Transition from Military to Civilian Life§Kendra Eguia, Monique Everett, Charlie Johnson, Kelly Sorbel§Anthropology 295S Honors Class§The military is a collective culture. Western societies are individualist cultures. The process of entering the military is a process of collectivistic conditioning through a rite of passage – “Boot Camp”; however, at discharge there exists no equivalent process of individualistic conditioning.\nUsing Grounded Theory, a research method of qualitative content data analysis, of our online survey’s written responses, to identify common themes, trends, and emerging patterns, which relate to the individuals’ experiences of transitioning back to civilian life.§

§A Woman’s Right to Choose: An Outsider’s View on the Role of a Female Jehovah’s Witness & Her Right to Choose to Accept It§A.J. Riley§Anthropology Club§There is an abundance of preconceived notions, most of which are negative in nature, about what it is like to be a female Jehovah’s Witness. These notions most often result in instantaneous judgments and a feeling of otherness towards the women. Over the course of my research, I attended weekly meetings and conducted interviews with female members of the church. My research demonstrates that the role of women in the church is much more complex. It is my intention with this paper to provide an insight into the choices women make as they identify as a Jehovah's witness in the hopes of engendering understanding and recognition.

§§Amber Owen§Anthropology Club§Ehler's Danlos syndrome is often overlooked, mistreated and misunderstood. Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome is a group of heritable connective tissue disorders that is characterized by joint hypermobility, connective tissue fragility and many other symptoms. For this project I interviewed 36 participants all of whom are diagnosed with Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome and are members of local support groups. I asked three questions of the participants, with the third question having a part two. Respondents reported that it took many years and multiple doctors to receive their diagnosis, and most felt that their symptoms were often minimized by their health care providers. This is a relatively small data pool and warrants more research; this is indicative of larger issues that is not only related to EDS, but many rare or rarely known chronic health issues. Women are also more likely to be dismissed and mistreated by medical providers; this is a cultural issue that must be addressed.

§Ancient Egyptian vs Modern Toothpaste§Charlie Johnson, David Alexander, & Isabella Lucas §ANTH 204§This research project seeks to compare differences between ancient Egyptian toothcare methods and modern toothpaste recipes.  Using ingredients as close to the originals as possible (rock salt, peppercorn, iris flower, and mint) we recreated a toothpaste used by in Ancient Egypt as early as 400 AD.  This particular recipe was found in Vienna, Austria in a group of artifacts discovered in a trash pile outside the Egyptian city of Crocodilopolis.  We compared it against two modern alternatives – a fluoride free recipe and a prescription strength Colgate recipe – to provide contrast.§§
